###         Comparison Operators            ###

#Are the same as in any other programming language

# ==: equality
# !-: Not equal
# > : Greater than
# < : Smaller than
# >=: Greater or equal
# <=: Smaller or equal

#Logical operators

#Are different than in C/C++

#and operator
#or operator
#not operator

print(2>3 and 1<2) #Will return a false, (same as &&)

print('A' == 'a' or 1==1) #Will return a true, (same as ||)


print(not 1==1) #Will return a false (returns always return the opposite of a comparison result (same as !)

print(1<2==1) #Will compute 1<2 first, then 2 == 1 (returns a false)
